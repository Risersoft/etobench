# Browser

A browser is a pre-defined set of views with filters pre-applied. This is presented in the form of nodes in a tree in the left hand pane and a new view is generated when a node is selected.

To go to the work order browser, select any work order and right click and select “Browse Work Order”

PowerBOM output is mostly contained in this browser screen and various reports are neatly presented in an explorer-like interface ready to be viewed and printed.
