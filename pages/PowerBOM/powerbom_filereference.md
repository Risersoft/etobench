# File Reference

![](/images/file-reference-select.png)

This is similar to the standard drawing reference but allows you to call a drawing item from any other work order. You first select a work order and the list of documents in that work order is displayed in the bottom left grid. When you select a document, the parts are displayed on the right and you can select the drawing item that you want to refer.

As in the standard reference, the BOM tree is displayed.
