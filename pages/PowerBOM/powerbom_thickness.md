## Thickness


![](/images/thickness-drawing.png)

In this case, when we select an item from the details grid, density and thickness are automatically displayed. We need to enter Length / Width or ID/OD on the dimensionâ€™s side. PowerBOM calculates area from the information available and then multiplied by thickness and density to get the weight.

###### Weight Reduction

Often times, in this type of material, there is a profiling in external boundary or internal portions. In such cases we can choose the type of area reductions (rectangular, round, triangle, radius) and then enter those dimensions. PowerBOM computes the total area removed and takes it into account during calculation of weight
