## Coding System Definition

![](/images/code-definition.png)

In this screen, we define what the rest of the digits in the item code will mean. We first define the no. of groups and then the name of each group and no. of characters in that group.

Optionally we can define a table of values and texts where we can enter meaning of “digit codes”. Sometimes the digits denote just a dimension which is in the item name (for example 6 mm thk = 60) and in that case this translation table is not needed.

PowerBOM interprets the item coding system defined by you and generates a picture which can be seen in the picture tab.

This picture along with the Remark can be printed from “Generate format Sub Category Definitions” to produce a nicely formatted coding system manual.

Please note that definition and use of coding system Is entirely optional and the generation of other PowerBOM reports does not depend on it.
