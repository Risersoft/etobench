# Numbering Features

PowerBOM assists you in preparing the bill of material by disallowing duplicate numbering.

When you assign an item number that already exists in the document, following box is displayed:

![](/images/number-feature-power-bom.png)

If you press OK, all assigned numbers are shifted to the next one.

Further you can press Shift Up button in the bill of materials tab to shift all numbers by (-1). This is required, for example, when you have deleted a drawing item and you donâ€™t want to leave the number blank.
