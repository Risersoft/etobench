# Specific CNC File for Calculated Drawing Item



For dxf file for nesting, we can select “Edit Drawing Item Calculated” from the context menu:

![](/images/specific-cnc.png)

This will open up the drawing item calculated screen.

![](/images/specific-cnc-calculated-screen.png)

Here we can associate specific drawings for this parametric item. When we do so, this drawing will override the drawing given in the original drawing item part.
