# Hardware

![](/images/hardware.png)

Hardware has been given a special treatment in PowerBOM. Primarily it tries to solve two issues, while keeping the integration with inventory intact:

1.  Selection from a vast variety of material

For this the parameters are given at the top â€“ Thread Type, Material, Hardware Type and Class. These have been defined in the Hardware Item Schedule. Upon selection of these, the appropriate sub category is shown in the upper left grid. Upon selection of sub category, the item grid is populated.

2.  Easy set formation (screw / nut / washer etc.)

When we select the item, the element grid on the right is populated along with all the associated elements, provided they are in the inventory item code list and data has been filled.

Certain elements like lock nuts and spring washers can be chosen from the drop down combo box.

Thus the set is easily formed and all item code information is saved along with the drawing item.
