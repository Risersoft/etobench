# Item Collection

![](/images/item-collection.png)

This functionality is basically meant for Labels but can be extended to any other item collection by appropriately marking in the “PowerBOM Material Type” screen.

When we select the sub category from the combo box, the details grid is populated to fill the items in this sub category. The first parameter in the subcategory is also displayed.

For the labels sub category, following is the data:

![](/images/item-collection-item-sub-category.png)

When we select the first parameter, the item grid is further filtered to include only those items whose parameter value is equal to the value chosen.

Now we can select the quantity for each item.

Once we click OK, the drawing item is displayed as follows:

![](/images/item-collection-standard-drawing.png)

This functionality assumes that labels generally have a drawing no. and an item no.

You can use this screen for any item that satisfies above criteria.
