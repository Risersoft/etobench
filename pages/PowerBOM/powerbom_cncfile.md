For each part item, upto 4 dxf file can be associated. More than 1 files are required when you need to split a part due to sheet limitations, for example. You click on Browse to select a file and then you can view it using the view button via the built-in DXF viewer. You can use “Clear “button to remove the reference.

CNC files are required for nesting.
