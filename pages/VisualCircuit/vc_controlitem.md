# Control Item


Control item is the basis of all intelligent device information in VisualCircuit.  This entity links to the inventory by way of reference to versions and defines schematic information in terms of terminals and their types. Later in Work Order Schematics we add this “control item” to a “panel” and assign buses to its terminals.

When you add/edit a control item, the following screen is presented:
