# Terminal Sets Master


![](/images/terminal-sets-master.png)

When you add/edit a terminal set, following screen is presented:


![](/images/terminal-sets-master-view.png)

|Description|Description of this terminal set|
|:----------|:-------------------------------|
|No. of Terminals|No. of terminals in this terminal set.  Depending on this, the grid “Terminal Setup and Location” and the image on the right is setup|
|Set Type|This information is shown during work order schematic preparation and helps to get the correct terminal nos.|
|Image|You can use the browse button to get a graphical image and then use the scale factor slider to adjust the size so that its width does not exceed 2-2.5” in general. This is because the wiring diagram report will print 3 columns in A4 page.|
|Do Not Provide White Space|VisualCircuit adds a white space between terminal sets of a component by default. You can select this check box if this is not required.|
|Terminal Setup and Location|Depending on the no. of terminals entered, the grid displays the terminals and their name and alignment.In the image on the upper right, each terminal is represented by WN-x and TN-x where WN=Wire No., TN = Terminal No., and x = Terminal Name from the bottom grid. You can move around the boxes in the image and VisualCircuit will remember their location.During work order schematic preparation, VisualCircuit will generate a new image based on the terminal set, terminal no and the wire no. Alignment of text will be done as per defined in the terminal set.|
