# Item Coding System



VisualCircuit provides a comprehensive item coding system maintenance facility. The item coding system is divided into three levels â€“ schedule, sub category and item code.

If you have an existing system of item codes, the same can be entered in VisualCircuit to make it in sync with your ERP / management system.

If you do not have an existing system, the same can be developed and entered.

The existing data in VisualCircuit has been provided as an example to get you started.

Below is the sample of the Item Sub Category System Definition Report which can be generated by right clicking in the context of any sub category and selecting from the context menu:
