# Component Assignment


Now we can add these terminal sets to the component. On the “Component Terminal Sets” tab, if you add/edit, following screen is presented:

Once we select the terminal set from the drop down box, the “Enter Values” grid is populated and we can enter the terminal names for this component. The image on the right is generated showing how it looks with the terminal nos. Wire nos. will be added once this component is used in a work order schematic.

If we check the “Use Separate Interconnection cable” check box, a separate interconnection cable will be generated for buses involved with this component. Otherwise all buses from panel A to panel B are grouped in one interconnection cable.

Finally, when you are finished with adding all terminal sets, the component terminal set tab looks like following:

You can use the “move up”, “move down” buttons to sort the terminal sets and get the desired effect.
